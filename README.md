# Projects

I have many many silly projects

[![Lily's top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=rctcwyvrn&layout=compact)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

## Personal highlights
- [rlox](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/rlox), A `rust` bytecode compiler and VM for the `Lox` language
- [tal-inference](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/tal-inference), type inference on an assembly subset. It _kinda_ works.
- [queens](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/queens), a whole bunch of really really dumb AI players for the Amazons board game, based on this tom7 video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXy041BIlA 
- [rust-fractran](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/rust-fractran), did you know that fractions are Turing complete? Watch me compute prime numbers using them 
- [rop-fk](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/rop-fk), using return oriented programming to make a bf interpreter

## Cryptography projects
- [blake3](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/blake3), a simple implementation of the blake3 hash function in pure java
- [py_hash_sigs](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/py_hash_sigs), while on a flight I implemented some hash based signature schemes, which are very cool (and going to be standardized in the post quantum nist competition! See SPHINCS)
- [cryptopals](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/ctf_stuff/tree/master/cryptopals), solutions for the original [Matasano Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) sets. Lots of fun attacks on real cryptography

## Word game solvers
- [letter_boxed](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/letter_boxed_solver), a solver for [https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed)
- [sidewords](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/sidewords), a solver for [https://sidewords.ca/](https://sidewords.ca/)

## Other stuff
- [jlox](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/jlox): A `java` tree walk interpreter for `Lox`
- [minecraft_api](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/minecraft_api), we wanted an api to connect our minecraft server messages to a discord bot, so I wrote this little `rust` project
- [advent](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/advent), some Advent of Code solutions, a few of these got in the daily top 100 placings!
- [sudoku](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/sudoku), a little `haskell` project, just a simple backtracking sudoku solver
- [YAOPD](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/YAOPD), a generator for obfuscated malicious powershell scripts. Originally to be part of a machine learning deobfuscation project but my partner ditched me
- [py_spec](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/py_spec). You know those circular audio waveform things? I wanted a script that could generate those for me so I wrote one. It works _ok_
- [python-bees](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/python-bees), a `python` implementation of the `Artificial Bee Colony` algoirthm, which is this weird meta-heuristic algorithm based on bee foraging patterns
